=> A RESTful API is an Application Progarm Interface.
   RESTful APIs are used to provide communication between two parties over a network.
   RESTful APIs are developed using REST rules.
   REST are set of rules to develop modern web applications to send and receive data over the network.
   *REST API is a web application and has it's own url.
   *Note: REST APIs are not used to serve any web applications, instead  of that they are used as an Interface
   between two parties to provide communication between then over the network with its url.

*REST - (Representational State Tranfer)
-----------------------------------------
=>Example: Github REST API(or) Github RESTful API
           > curl https://api.github.com/users/AutomationWithScripting/repos
             we will get repo list form the account as a json data.
           > Client: The client is a person or software who uses the API.
                Here: curl/browser/Progarm/script/any application
           > Resource: A resource can be any object that API can provide information about.
                Here: Github account repos

*REST means when a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer the representation of the
 state of the requested resource to client.

*Basic Concept of REST APIs
-----------------------------
url : https://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees
      https://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employee/1 
=> Concepts : > Base url or Root Endpoint: https://dummy.restapiexample.com
              > Endpoints/Routs : api/v1/employees
                                  api/v1/employee/1
              > Resource : A data in web Application.
                           Endpoints are useful to work with Resource(s).
              > HTTP Verbs/Methods/Operations : We have to execute different methods on Endpoints
                                                based on requirment. Those Methods/Operations are
                                                called HTTP Verbs.
                                                > Different HTTP Verbs are :GET,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE etc.
                                                > GET is used to get existing data from web application.
                                                > POST is used to send data to web application.
                                                > PUT is used to update existing information.
                                                > PATCH is to update partially the info(not entire info).
                                                > DELETE is to delete resource from web application.
=> So REST API url is BASE URL + Endpoint
