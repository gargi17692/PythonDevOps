# Design REST API for an Employee Info ?

Steps to implement REST API:
   > Base URL?ROOT ENDpoint(where your REST API is running)
                  > http://localhost:5000
   > Endpoints:
        > /info
   > Resource:
        > Employee Information
   > HTTP Verbs/Methods:
        > GET
   > Now our REST APIs are:
        > Base URL + Endpoints 
              > http://localhost:5000/info
                  and available method 'GET'.
