Oop_Principles :
=================
1.Encapsulation :-
---------------------
=> *Encapsulation refers to a mechanism of restricting the direct access 
    to some of our attributes in a program.
   *Restricting the ability to override the values of your objects within
    your saddles, exactly what about Encapsulation.
2.Abstraction :-
--------------------
=> Abstraction is the concept of Object Oriented Programming that only shows
   the necessary attributes and hides unnecessary informations; from users who
   are going to create some item objects.
3.Inheritance :-
-------------------
=> Inheritance is a mechanism that allows users to reuse code across our classes.
4.Polymerphism :-
------------------
=> Polymerphism refers to use of a single type entity to represent different types
   in different scenarios. The idea of applying Polymerphism on our program is the 
   ability to have different scenarios, when we call excat same entity or function.
   for eg; name="jim" # str
           print(len(name)) #3
           my_list=["Radha","Krushna"]
           print(len(my_list)) #2
   *That's Polymerphism in Actions, A single function does now how to handle 
    different kinds of objects as expected.
